# Waste Classification using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste images into two categories: Organic and Recyclable. The goal is to automate waste segregation by identifying the type of waste from an image, contributing to efficient recycling and waste management.

## Project Overview
This waste classification model uses deep learning techniques to classify images of waste. The CNN architecture enables the model to learn important features from images, distinguishing between organic and recyclable waste. The model can be integrated into smart waste management systems to facilitate efficient sorting.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of organic and recyclable waste. The images are preprocessed and augmented to improve model performance.

### Dataset Structure:
- **Organic:** Food waste, garden waste, etc.
- **Recyclable:** Plastics, paper, glass, metals, etc.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of the following layers:
1. Convolutional Layers
2. Max-Pooling Layers
3. Flatten Layer
4. Fully Connected (Dense) Layers
5. Output Layer with Softmax Activation (for binary classification)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/waste-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd waste-classification
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by placing images into the respective folders (Organic and Recyclable).
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
4. Classify new images:
   ```bash
   python classify.py --image path_to_image.jpg
   ```

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between organic and recyclable waste. The confusion matrix and classification report are generated after training, providing insights into model performance.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve the model, add new features, or fix bugs, feel free to submit a pull request.
